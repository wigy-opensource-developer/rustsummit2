# Inversion of Control in Rust

A tale about depending on abstractions by an old guy who remembers Java times.

## What is on the plate

- What is an abstraction?
- What kind of abstractions exist in Rust?
- Cool techniques using these abstractions
- Scaring you all with a Polkadot SDK pallet (maybe it will not be that scary
  after all the other points...)

## Who am I

- Working in blockchain space since 2015
- Has been on Bastian KÃ¶cher's team in Parity for a year
- Architect of Mosaic Chain (ðŸ¤« sssshhhh! We are hiring good Rust devs or
  looking for partnerships with Rust developer teams...)
